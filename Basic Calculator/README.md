- Input of decimal numbers
- All-clear functionality to reset the calculator
- Calculation result displayed in real-time

## Usage
To use the calculator, simply open the calculator.html file in a web browser. The calculator interface will be displayed, and you can click on the buttons to input numbers and perform calculations.

1. The calculator screen displays the current value and the result of calculations.
1. Use the number buttons (0-9) to input digits.
1. Use the operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform arithmetic operations.
1. The decimal button (.) allows inputting decimal numbers.
1. The AC button clears the calculator and resets it to the initial state.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- **'calculator.html'**: The main HTML file that contains the calculator interface.
- **'calculator_CSS.css'**: The CSS file that defines the styles for the calculator interface.
- **'calculator_JS.js'**: The JavaScript file that provides the logic and functionality for the calculator.

## What Was Learned
This project serves as a learning exercise for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through this project, the following concepts were covered:

- Building a basic HTML structure and organizing elements.
- Styling HTML elements using CSS.
- Using JavaScript to handle user interactions and perform calculations.
- Manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) to update the calculator display in real-time.
- Implementing event listeners to respond to button clicks.
- Creating functions to handle input digits, decimal points, operators, and calculator reset.
- Using objects and functions to organize and perform arithmetic calculations.  

Completing this project has given me basic hands-on experience in front-end web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as understanding the basics of event handling and DOM manipulation.
