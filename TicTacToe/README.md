# Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all squares are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a tie.

## Features
- Interactive game interface.
- Two-player gameplay.
- Sound effects for symbol placement, win, and tie.
- Automatic computer move for player 'O' (computer's move is randomly generated).

## Usage
1. Open the index.html file in a web browser.
1. The game interface will be displayed with an empty 3x3 grid.
1. Click on an empty square to place your symbol ('X' or 'O').
1. The game will automatically switch turns between players.
1. The game will end and reset when a player wins or there is a tie.

## Project Structure
- **'index.html'**: The main HTML file that contains the game interface structure.
- **'css/game.css'**: The CSS file that defines the styles for the game interface.
- **'js/tictactoe.js'**: The JavaScript file that implements the game logic.

## What Was Learned
By working on this project, several key concepts and techniques were learned:

- Manipulating the DOM using JavaScript to create interactive web applications.
- Handling user events and interactions through event listeners.
- Implementing game logic for turn-based games.
- Generating random moves for computer players.
- Animating drawings on a canvas element.
- Playing audio files using JavaScript.  

Overall, this project helped me to reinforce HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while applying them to create a functional and interactive game.
