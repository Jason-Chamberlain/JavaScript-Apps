Yakitiyak's Pizza Forge is a web application for customizing and ordering pizzas. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers an interactive menu where users can select various options to create their perfect pizza. The menu allows users to choose the pizza size, crust type, sauce, cheese, vegetable toppings, meat toppings, and herbs. As users make their selections, the chosen options and the total price are displayed in real-time.
